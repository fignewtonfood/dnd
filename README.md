## Description

This program is the week-long group project for Epicodus.  It will provide easy, simplified construction steps for new D&D5e characters--perfect for beginners!--and store its data in a MySQL database.  Dungeon Master's can access campaigns and organize all characters.

## Setup

* _Initialize your mysql databases by typing "mysql.server start" and "mysql -uroot -proot" in the terminal._
* _Type "apachectl start" in the terminal, then open localhost:8080/phpmyadmin in your web browser.  Password and username are both "root."_
* _Import the dnd.sql.zip file.  Import its test as well if you plan to run PHPUnit tests.
* _Clone directory from "https://github.com/fignewtonfood/dnd.git"_
* _run "composer install" into the terminal from the main folder directory._
* _run "php -S localhost:8000" from the web folder, then open that location in your web browser._
* _That's it!  Run this program from the root web page and follow onscreen directions._

## Technologies Used

PHP, Silex, Twig, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Composer, Symfony, MySQL.  Tests conducted with PHPUnit.
